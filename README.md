💡 How It Works
Adding a Task: Click the "Add New Task" button and fill in the form. The task is saved in localStorage and displayed in the task list.

Editing a Task: Click the "Edit" button next to any task. The form will populate with the task’s details for editing.

Deleting a Task: Click "Delete" to remove the task from the list and localStorage.

Closing Form: If there are unsaved changes, a dialog box asks whether to discard them.
